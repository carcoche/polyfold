## Contributing to the Code Base
When contributing to the code base, our best practices are as follows:

* Create new feature branches from the develop branch.
* Create initial pull requests from your feature branch to the develop branch.
* Test your code prior to submitting pull requests.
* When reviewing pull requests, carefully review the git diff before approving the changes.
* Make small, frequent commits that accomplish a single, identifiable change.
* Use descriptive, brief, present tense commit messages.
* When changes are merged from a feature branch to the develop branch, they should be 'squashed' and merged to keep a relatively clean develop branch commit log and a very tidy master commit log.
* Log your changes to the changelog in the following format:
    ```
    x.x.x
    -----
    - [Luke Skywalker] - Add feature to log last location of lightsaber.
    - [Han Solo] - Add feature to hide Luke's lightsaber.
    ```
    **NOTE:**
    * Present Tense
    * Punctuated
    * Version Placeholder Included *(this will be updated upon each push from develop to master)*
    * Roughly One Line per Change *(keep it brief!)*

## Conventions Used
* A line preceded by '$' indicates a line run at the command line prompt
